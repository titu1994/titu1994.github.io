                DCCNN is a Convolutional neural network architecture which is inspired by the <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/cvpr2012.pdf">Multi Columnar Deep Neural Network of Ciresan (2012)</a>. Using improvements from recent papers such as Batch Normalization, Leaky Relu, Inception BottleNeck blocks and Convolutional Subsampling, the network uses very few parameters in order to acheive near state of the art performance on various datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR 10/100, and SHVN. Although it does not improve on the state of the art, it shows that smaller architectures with far fewer parameters can rival the performance of large ensemble networks.
