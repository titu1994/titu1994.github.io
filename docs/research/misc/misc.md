## [Parallel Quick Sort using Thread Pool Pattern](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3536/3f8ccda03736320f3ebff92e744dbd245257.pdf)

!!!abstract
    Sorting algorithms, their implementations and their applications in modern computing necessitates improvements for sorting large data sets quickly and efficiently. This paper will analyze the performance of a multi-threaded quick sort
    implemented using the thread pool pattern. The analysis will be done by comparing the time required to sort various data
    sets and their memory constraints, against the native sorting implementations of the Dual Pivot Quicksort and Merge Sort
    using the Fork-Join framework in the Oracle Java 8 programming language. Analysis is done of the effect of
    different number of processor (cores) of the test machine, as well as the performance barrier due to the initial time taken to
    create “p” threads, p being the number of processors. This paper also analyzes the limitations of the inbuilt Java method
    Arrays.parallelSort() and how the proposed system overcomes this problem. Finally, it also discuss possible improvements to
    the proposed system to further improve its performance.

## [AdaSort: Adaptive Sorting using Machine Learning](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0bb8/8283a5d84840f03a413a0b0cacff020d74d7.pdf)

!!!abstract
    Sorting algorithms and their implementations in modern
    computing requires improvements in sorting large data sets
    effectively, both with respect to time and memory consumed.
    This paper is aimed at reviewing multiple adaptive sorting
    algorithms, on the basis of selection of an algorithm based on
    the characteristics of the data set. Machine Learning allows us
    to construct an adaptive algorithm based on the analysis of the
    experimental data. A review of algorithms designed using
    Systems of Algorithmic Algebra and Genetic Algorithms was
    performed. Both methods are designed to target different use
    cases. Systems of Algorithmic Algebra is a representation of
    pseudo code that can be converted to high level code using
    Integrated toolkit for Design and Synthesis of programs, while
    the Genetic Algorithm attempts to optimize its fitness function
    and generate the most successful algorithm.

## [A Comprehensive Comparison between Neural Style Transfer and Universal Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00868)

!!!abstract
    Style transfer aims to transfer arbitrary visual styles to content images.
    We explore algorithms adapted from two papers that try to solve the problem of style
    transfer while generalizing on unseen styles or compromised visual quality.
    Majority of the improvements made focus on optimizing the algorithm for real-time
    style transfer while adapting to new styles with considerably less resources
    and constraints. We compare these strategies and compare how they measure up
    to produce visually appealing images. We explore two approaches to style transfer:
    neural style transfer with improvements and universal style transfer. We also
    make a comparison between the different images produced and how they can be
    qualitatively measured.
