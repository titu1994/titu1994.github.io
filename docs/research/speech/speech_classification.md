## [MatchboxNet: 1D Time-Channel Separable Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Speech Commands Recognition](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2020/majumdar20_interspeech)

!!!abstract
    We present MatchboxNet â€” an end-to-end neural network for speech command recognition. MatchboxNet is a 
    deep residual network composed from blocks of 1D time-channel separable convolution, batch-normalization,
    ReLU and dropout layers. MatchboxNet reaches state-of-the art accuracy on the Google Speech Commands 
    dataset while having significantly fewer parameters than similar models. The small footprint of 
    MatchboxNet makes it an attractive candidate for devices with limited computational resources. The model
    is highly scalable, so model accuracy can be improved with modest additional memory and compute. Finally,
    we show how intensive data augmentation using an auxiliary noise dataset improves robustness in the
    presence of background noise.

## [MarbleNet: Deep 1D Time-Channel Separable Convolutional Neural Network for Voice Activity](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9414470)

!!!abstract
    We present MarbleNet, an end-to-end neural network for Voice Activity Detection (VAD). MarbleNet 
    is a deep residual network composed from blocks of 1D time-channel separable convolution, batch-normalization,
    ReLU and dropout layers. When compared to a state-of-the-art VAD model, MarbleNet is able to achieve 
    similar performance with roughly 1/10-th the parameter cost. We further conduct extensive ablation studies
    on  different training methods and choices of parameters in order to study the robustness of MarbleNet in 
    real-world VAD tasks.
