## [Microaneurysm detection using fully convolutional neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260717308544)

!!!abstract
    Backround and Objectives.<br>
    Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes that can lead to sight loss if 
    treated not early enough. Microaneurysms are the earliest clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy. 
    This paper presents an automatic method for detecting microaneurysms in fundus photographies.
    <br>
    Methods<br>
    A novel patch-based fully convolutional neural network with batch normalization layers and Dice 
    loss function is proposed. Compared to other methods that require up to five processing stages, 
    it requires only three. Furthermore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper 
    that shows how to successfully transfer knowledge between datasets in the microaneurysm detection domain.
    <br>
    Results<br>
    The proposed method was evaluated using three publicly available and widely used datasets: E-Ophtha,
    DIARETDB1, and ROC. It achieved better results than state-of-the-art methods using the FROC metric. 
    The proposed algorithm accomplished highest sensitivities for low false positive rates, which is 
    particularly important for screening purposes.

## [Exudate segmentation using fully convolutional neural networks and inception modules](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10574/1057430/Exudate-segmentation-using-fully-convolutional-neural-networks-and-inception-modules/10.1117/12.2293549.short?SSO=1)

!!!abstract
    Diabetic retinopathy is an eye disease associated with diabetes mellitus and also it is the leading cause of
    preventable blindness in working-age population. Early detection and treatment of DR is essential to prevent 
    vision loss. Exudates are one of the earliest signs of diabetic retinopathy. This paper proposes an automatic
    method for the detection and segmentation of exudates in fundus photographies. A novel fully convolutional 
    neural network architecture with Inception modules is proposed. Compared to other methods it does not require
    the removal of other anatomical structures. Furthermore, a transfer learning approach is applied between small
    datasets of different modalities from the same domain. To the best of authors’ knowledge, it is the first time
    that such approach has been used in the exudate segmentation domain. The proposed method was evaluated using
    publicly available E-Ophtha datasets. It achieved better results than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of 
    sensitivity and specificity metrics. The proposed algorithm accomplished better results using a diseased/not
    diseased evaluation scenario which indicates its applicability for screening purposes. Simplicity, performance,
    efficiency and robustness of the proposed method demonstrate its suitability for diabetic retinopathy screening
    applications.

## [Microaneurysm detection using deep learning and interleaved freezing](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10574/105741I/Microaneurysm-detection-using-deep-learning-and-interleaved-freezing/10.1117/12.2293520.short)

!!!abstract
    Diabetes affects one in eleven adults. Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes and 
    the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population. Microaneurysms are the earliest clinical signs
    of diabetic retinopathy. This paper proposes an automatic method for detecting microaneurysms in fundus 
    photographies. A novel patch-based fully convolutional neural network for detection of microaneurysms is
    proposed. Compared to other methods that require five processing stages, it requires only two. Furthermore,
    a novel network fine-tuning scheme called Interleaved Freezing is presented. This procedure significantly 
    reduces the amount of time needed to re-train a network and produces competitive results. The proposed method
    was evaluated using publicly available and widely used datasets: E-Ophtha and ROC. It outperforms the 
    state-of-the-art methods in terms of free-response receiver operatic characteristic (FROC) metric. Simplicity,
    performance, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method demonstrate its suitability for diabetic 
    retinopathy screening applications.
