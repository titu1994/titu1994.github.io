## [Multivariate LSTM-FCNs for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04503)

!!!abstract
    Over the past decade, multivariate time series classification has been receiving a lot of attention. We propose augmenting the existing univariate time series classification models, LSTM-FCN and ALSTM-FCN with a squeeze and excitation block to further improve performance. Our proposed models outperform most of the state of the art models while requiring minimum preprocessing. The proposed models work efficiently on various complex multivariate time series classification tasks such as activity recognition or action recognition. Furthermore, the proposed models are highly efficient at test time and small enough to deploy on memory constrained systems.

## [LSTM Fully Convolutional Networks for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05206)

!!!abstract
    Fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on
    the task of classifying time series sequences. We propose the augmentation of fully convolutional
    networks with long short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) sub-modules for time series
    classification. Our proposed models significantly enhance the performance of fully convolutional
    networks with a nominal increase in model size and require minimal preprocessing of the dataset.
    The proposed Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN) achieves state-of-the-art
    performance compared to others. We also explore the usage of attention mechanism to improve time
    series classification with the Attention Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network
    (ALSTM-FCN). Utilization of the attention mechanism allows one to visualize the decision process
    of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, we propose fine-tuning as a method to enhance the performance of
    trained models. An overall analysis of the performance of our model is provided and compared to
    other techniques.

## [A Comprehensive Comparison between Neural Style Transfer and Universal Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00868)

!!!abstract
    Style transfer aims to transfer arbitrary visual styles to content images. We explore algorithms adapted from two papers that try to solve the problem of style transfer while generalizing on unseen styles or compromised visual quality. Majority of the improvements made focus on optimizing the algorithm for real-time style transfer while adapting to new styles with considerably less resources and constraints. We compare these strategies and compare how they measure up to produce visually appealing images. We explore two approaches to style transfer: neural style transfer with improvements and universal style transfer. We also make a comparison between the different images produced and how they can be qualitatively measured.
