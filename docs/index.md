# About Me

I'm a Deep Learning and Machine Learning Research enthusiast, currently attempting to implement and
analyze various papers in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

For me, research needs to be distributed to as many sources as possible, so that practical applications
from that work can be applied in the field, and is available to as many as possible.

I enjoy working on Image Classification and many of its sub-domains, Time Series Classification and
have recently started to expand my horizons further - architecture search, optimizers, mobile computing and more.
