## Image Super-Resolution

Implementation of Image Super Resolution CNNs in Keras from the paper `Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks`.

Also contains a modular framework, which allows a variety of other super resolution models to be trained and distilled :

1) `Denoising Autoencoder SR models` <br>
2) `ResNet SR models`  <br>
3) `Efficient SubPixel Convolutional SR models` <br>
4) `Distilled ResNet SR models` <br>
5) `Non-Local ResNet SR models` (experimental) <br>

## Image Super-Resolution using GANs

An incomplete project that attempts to implement the SRGAN model proposed in the paper `Photo-Realistic Single
 Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network` in Keras.
