# [Tensorflow ODE Solver](https://github.com/titu1994/tfdiffeq)

A library built to replicate the [TorchDiffEq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq) library built for the [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations paper by Chen et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366), running entirely on Tensorflow Eager Execution.

All credits for the codebase go to [@rtqichen](https://github.com/rtqichen) for providing an excellent base to reimplement from.

Similar to the PyTorch codebase, this library provides ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers implemented in Tensorflow Eager. For usage of ODE solvers in deep learning applications, see [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366).

As the solvers are implemented in Tensorflow, algorithms in this repository are fully supported to run on the GPU.
