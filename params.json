Some were pet projects, some are under current development and a few which have already been deployed.\r\n\r\n## Ragial Notifier\r\nAn Android Application developed to act as a convenience for ragial.com, an item price tracking website for the popular MMORPG Ragnarok Online, developed by Gravity Inc. The entire application is developed with efficiently delivering notifications to users when an item they are tracking is on sale. This application is also very efficient when parsing ragial.com, so as to reduce the load on their servers.\r\n\r\nLink : <http://titu1994.github.io/RagialNotifier/> \r\n\r\nGoogle Play Store Link : <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.somshubra.ragialnotifier>.\r\n\r\n## Ragial Searcher\r\nRagial searcher is a Java library to parse and store data from ragial.com, often used the the online mmorpg, Ragnarok Online and used as a library in the Android Application - Ragial Notifier \r\n\r\nLink : <http://titu1994.github.io/Ragial-Searcher/>\r\n\r\n## Maths Assessment Tool\r\nA C# Windows Form based application developed upon request of Muktangan. It calculates a students competencies in a format simple for teachers to manage. Co-developed with Ishaan Jain.\r\n\r\nLink : <https://github.com/ishaanj/GradeAssessmentTool>\r\n\r\n## Basic Building Blocks\r\nA mixture of various building blocks for apps. Contains the sort folder, which holds the ParallelQuickSort class. This class manages a ThreadPool to use multiple threads and sort the data using QuickSort algorithm as its base. Generally 2-3 times faster than Arrays.sort(), and while marginally slower than Arrays.parallelSort(), it can sort up to 800 Million data items without crashing. Arrays.parallelSort() will crash on any data set larger than 100 Million data items.\r\n\r\nLink : <http://titu1994.github.io/Basic-Blocks/>\r\n\r\nLink to ParallelQuickSort : <https://github.com/titu1994/Basic-Blocks/blob/master/Basic%20Blocks/src/com/somshubra/sort/ParallelQuickSort.java>\r\n\r\n## GetFresh\r\nAn Android Application developed to order dishes from the website getfresh.in in an efficient manner.\r\n\r\nLink : <https://github.com/ishaanj/GetFreshApp>\r\n\r\n## Java 8086 Microprocessor\r\nAn attempt to emulate the execution environment of the 8086 Microprocessor. Currently, input parsing and implementation of JMP type asm code is left.\r\n\r\nLink : <http://titu1994.github.io/8086-Microprocessor/>\r\n\r\n## Others..\r\nIn the last 3 years that I have used GitHub, I have developed a myriad of programs. \r\n\r\nLink : <https://github.com/titu1994?tab=repositories>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
